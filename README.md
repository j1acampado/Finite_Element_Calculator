# Finite Element Calculator in MATLAB

This repository contains a Finite Element Method (FEM) calculator developed in MATLAB. The tool is designed to compute stresses, displacements, and strains on various structures, such as beams, trusses, and bars, using 2D and 3D FEM models. It takes input files and provides accurate results for structural analysis applications.

## Features

- **Supports 2D and 3D structural analysis**.
- **Calculates stresses, strains, and displacements** for beams, trusses, and bars.
- **Processes input files** to configure structure geometry, material properties, and loading conditions.
- **User-friendly output** for analysis and visualization.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Input Files**: Define geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions in input files.
2. **Run MATLAB Code**: The code processes input files to calculate the stresses, strains, and displacements.
3. **Review Results**: Output files or console outputs provide the calculated data, which can be visualized for further analysis.

## Requirements

- MATLAB (Version X.X or later)
- Input files formatted as per the provided examples.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/finite-element-calculator.git
   ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder containing the cloned repository.

3. Run the script:
   ```matlab
   FEM_calculator(input_file)
   ```

4. The output will display the calculated values of stresses, strains, and displacements based on the provided input file.

## Example

Example input and output files are included in the `/examples` folder for reference.
